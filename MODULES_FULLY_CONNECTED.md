- Middleware protection for all routes

**Test Accounts:**
- **Admin**: admin@gss.com / admin123
- **Manager**: manager@gss.com / manager123
- **HR**: hr@gss.com / hr123

### 📊 Database Connection

// Manager and Admin routes
/approvals/* - Requires manager or admin role
/payroll/* - Requires manager or admin role

// All authenticated users
/dashboard/* - Requires any authenticated user
/employees/* - Requires any authenticated user
/attendance/* - Requires any authenticated user
\`\`\`

**Database-Level Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Role-based data filtering
- Audit logging for all actions
- Secure password storage

### 📈 Data Flow

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User logs in with email/password
2. Server verifies credentials against user_profiles table
3. JWT token generated and stored in HTTP-only cookie
4. Token verified on each request via middleware
5. User role determines accessible routes and data

**Data Access Flow:**
1. Client requests data from protected route
2. Middleware verifies JWT token and role
3. Server queries database with role-based filters
4. Data returned to client with proper formatting
5. All actions logged in system_activity table

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations

**Database:**
- Connection pooling for scalability
- Indexed queries for fast lookups
- Prepared statements for security
- Query result caching where appropriate

**Frontend:**
- Server-side rendering for initial load
- Client-side state management with SWR
- Optimistic UI updates
- Lazy loading for large datasets
